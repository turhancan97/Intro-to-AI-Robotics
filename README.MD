## Some Questions and Answers

* Multi-agent foraging. Start with only a phototropic and avoid-robot behavior, where a robot is an obstacle that isnâ€™t a light. The program will start with an empty world consisting of a light (you may need to make a "bigger light" by placing lights next to each other). Between 2 and 5 phototropic robots will be placed at different random starting locations in the world. Each will wander through the world, avoiding obstacles, until it comes to a light. Then it will move directly to the light (attractive field). If more than one robot is attracted to the same light, they should center themselves evenly around the light.

* Cooperating to bring the food home. Add the push-to-home behavior where the robot wants to be on a straight line behind the light to home.
