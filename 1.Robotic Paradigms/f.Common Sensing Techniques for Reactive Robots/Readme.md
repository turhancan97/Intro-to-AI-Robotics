1. Define sensor suite, active/passive sensors, dead reckoning, computer vision.

2. Compare and contrast the RGB and HSV color representations specifying the advantages and disadvantages of each type.

3. Ultrasonic sensors have many positive and negative attributes. Name and describe three positive and three negative attributes.

4. What is the difference between physical and logical redundancy?

5. Describe the three major problems of ultrasonic sensing, and define a hypothetical instance in which a robot would encounter each problem (such as a room with a large amount of glass surfaces).

6. Describe with examples the three attributes that should be considered for an entire sensing suite.

7. Consider a Lego Mindstorms robot. Classify the available sensors for it in terms of modalities.

8. Describe the problems of specular reflection, cross talk, and foreshortening with an ultrasonic transducer.

9. List the metrics for rating individual sensors and a sensor suite, and apply these metrics to a particular application.

10. An alternative to a Denning ring is to mount one or more sonars on a mast and turn the mast. Turning gives the robot a 360 coverage. Which do you think would be better, a fixed ring or a panning mast? Would a panning mast reduce problems of foreshortening, cross-talk, and specular reflection.

11. List and describe advantages and disadvantages of 3 different sensors, including one type of computer vision.

12. Describe all the different characteristics of sensors that must be evaluated when designing a sensor suite. In addition, give priorities for each to determine which you would consider to be the most and least important of these characteristics for a robot that was going to be designed for the 1994 AUVS Unmanned Ground Robotics Competition.

13. Pick a sensor suite that you think would do a good job if you were designing a robot for the 1995 UGV competition described in an earlier chapter. Explain what each sensor would do as well as describe the sensors and sensor suite in terms of the attributes listed in this chapter.

14. You are to design a sensor suite for a new robot for use by fire fighters. The robot is designed to seek out people in a smoke filled building. Keep in mind the following:

- Visibility is often very limited due to smoke.
- Heat can be both an attactive force (e.g. human) or repulsive (e.g. open flame).
- Obstacles may have a wide variety of sound absorbtion (e.g. carpeting or furniture) 

Describe the types of sensors that may be needed and how they will be used. Do not focus on how the robot moves around just on the sensors it will need to use. Extra credit: Comment on using simple voice recognition software and a microphone to seek out human voices (e.g., cries for help).

15. How are the concepts of logical sensors in robotics and polymorphism in objectoriented programming similar?

16. Define image function. What is the image function for
a. the left-right images in a stereo pair?
b. the depth map?

17.  What are two disadvantages of light stripers?

18.  Consider an obstacle avoidance behavior which consists of a perceptual schema that provides a polar plot of range and motor schema which directs the robot to the most open sector. List all the logical sensors covered in this chapter that can be used interchangeably for the perceptual schema. Which of these are logically redundant? Physically redundant?

19. Assume you had a mobile robot about 0.5 meters high and a planar laser range finder. What angle would you mount the laser at if the robot was intended to navigate

a. in a classroom?
b. in a hallway or reception area where the primary obstacle is people?
c. outdoors in unknown terrain?

State any assumptions your design is based on. Is there more information needed; if so, what?
20.  [Programming] Write your own code to give you the threshold of a small interleaved image.

21.  [World Wide Web] Search for Kludge, another robot built by Ian Horswill. Describe Kludgeâ€™s homemade whisker system and how well it works.

22. [Programming] Program a mobile robot to find and bump an orange tennis or soccer ball.

23. [Programming] Create a color histogram program. Construct the color histogram, E, for four different brightly colored objects, such as dolls of the South Park or the Simpsons cartoon characters. Present the program with a different image, I, of one of the characters and compute the histogram intersection with each of the four E. Does the highest match correctly identify the character? Why or why not?
