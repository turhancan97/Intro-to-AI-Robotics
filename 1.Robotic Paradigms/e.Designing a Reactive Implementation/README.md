1. What is the difference between a primitive and an abstract behavior?

   *  **Primitive behavior** is composed of only one perceptual schema and one motor schema; there is no need to have any coordinated control program. Primitive behaviors can be thought of being monolithic, where they do only one (“mono”) thing. Because they are usually a simple mapping from stimulus to response, they are often programmed as a single method, not composed from multiple methods or objects. The concept of Perceptual and Motor Schema is there, but hidden for the sake of implementation. Behaviors which are assembled from other behaviors or have multiple perceptual schema and motor schema will be referred to as abstract behaviors, because they are farther removed from the sensors and actuators than a primitive behavior. The use of the term **abstract behavior** should not be confused with an abstract class in OOP.
   *  Primitive behaviors and abstract behaviors are two different types of behaviors that can be used in robotic systems.
   *  Primitive behaviors are basic, low-level behaviors that are directly controlled by sensor inputs and have a well-defined set of actions. They are typically simple, atomic actions that the robot can perform, such as avoiding obstacles, following a line, or approaching a goal. Primitive behaviors are used to handle specific, well-defined tasks and are easy to implement, test and debug.
   *  Abstract behaviors, on the other hand, are higher-level behaviors that are built on top of primitive behaviors. They are more complex, involving multiple primitive behaviors and decision-making processes. Abstract behaviors can perform more complex tasks such as navigating through a maze, or interacting with humans. They are more difficult to implement, test and debug, but can handle more complex and dynamic environments.
   *  In summary, the main difference between primitive and abstract behaviors is that primitive behaviors are simple, low-level behaviors that are directly controlled by sensor inputs and have a well-defined set of actions, while abstract behaviors are higher-level behaviors that are built on top of primitive behaviors and can perform more complex tasks.

2. Define the following terms:

Imagine you have a robot and you want it to do different things depending on the situation. For example, if it sees an obstacle in front of it, it should avoid it, and if it sees a line on the ground it should follow it.

- **behavior table:** 
    
    A behavior table is like a list of instructions that tells the robot what to do in different situations. It's like a flow chart, where each box represents a different behavior and the arrows show how the robot should move from one behavior to another.

    In terms of expressing the behaviors for a task, it is often advantageous to construct a behavior table as one way of at least getting all the behaviors on a  single sheet of paper. The releaser for each behavior is helpful for confirming  that the behaviors will operate correctly without conflict (remember, accidently programming the robotic equivalent of male sticklebacks from Ch. 3  is undesirable). It is often useful for the designer to classify the motor schema  and the percept. For example, consider what happens if an implementation  has a purely reflexive move-to-goal motor schema and an avoid-obstacle behavior. What happens if the avoid-obstacle behavior causes the robot to lose  perception of the goal? Oops, the perceptual schema returns no goal and the  move-to-goal behavior is terminated! Probably what the designer assumed  was that the behavior would be a fixed-action pattern and thereby the robot  would persist in moving toward the last known location of the goal.

- causal chain

    A causal chain is like a chain of events that happen one after the other. It's like a story, where each event is linked to the next event. In our robot example, the robot sees an obstacle and then it avoids it.

    The causal chain  is critical, because it embodies the coordination control program logic just as  a FSA does. It can be implemented in the same way. In NLP, scripts allow  the computer to keep up with a conversation that may be abbreviated. For  example, consider a computer trying to read and translate a book where the  main character has stopped in a restaurant. Good writers often eliminate all  the details of an event to concentrate on the ones that matter. This missing,  but implied, information is easy to extract. Suppose the book started with  “John ordered lobster.” This is a clue that serves as an index into the current or relevant event of the script (eating at a restaurant), skipping over past  events (John arrived at the restaurant, John got a menu, etc.). They also focus  the system’s attention on the next likely event (look for a phrase that indicates John has placed an order), so the computer can instantiate the function  which looks for this event. If the next sentence is “Armand brought out the  lobster and refilled the white wine,” the computer can infer that Armand is  the waiter and that John had previously ordered and received white wine,  without having been explicitly told.

- coordinated control program

    A coordinated control program is like a conductor of an orchestra. It takes all the different instructions from the behavior table and makes sure that the robot does the right thing at the right time. It's like a boss, who makes sure that everyone is doing their job correctly and that everything is running smoothly.

    The coordinated control program is a function that coordinates any methods or schemas in the derived class.  Three classes are derived from the Schema Class: Behavior, Motor Schema,  and Perceptual Schema. Behaviors are composed of at least one Perceptual  Schema and one Motor Schema; these schemas act as the methods for the  Behavior class. A Perceptual Schema has at least one method; that method takes sensor input and transforms it into a data structure called a percept. A  Motor Schema has at least one method which transforms the percept into a  vector or other form of representing an action. Since schemas are independent, the Behavior object acts as a place holder or local storage area for the  percept. The Perceptual Schema is linked to the sensor(s), while the Motor Schema is linked to the robot’s actuators. The sensors and actuators can  be represented by their own software classes if needed; this is useful when  working with software drivers for the hardware.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="../../docs/image/coordinated_control.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/></p>


    To put it simply, a behavior table tells the robot what to do, a causal chain shows the order of the events and a coordinated control program makes sure that everything runs smoothly and in an orderly manner.

3. Can the perceptual schema and the motor schema for a behavior execute asynchronously, that is, have different update rates?

    Yes, the perceptual schema and the motor schema for a behavior can execute asynchronously, meaning they can have different update rates.

    Perceptual schema, also known as sensory processing, is responsible for processing sensor information, such as sensor readings from cameras, microphones, or infrared sensors, and updating the robot's internal state based on that information. The update rate for the perceptual schema will depend on the type of sensors used and the frequency at which they produce new data. For example, a camera sensor may produce new data at a higher rate than an infrared sensor.

    Motor schema, also known as actuation, is responsible for controlling the robot's actuators, such as wheels, arms, or grippers, and executing the actions specified by the behavior. The update rate for the motor schema will depend on the type of actuators used and the frequency at which they need to be updated to execute the desired actions. For example, a robot with high-speed wheels will require a higher update rate than a robot with slower wheels.

    In some cases, the update rate of the perceptual schema may be faster than the update rate of the motor schema. In such cases, the robot may have to buffer the sensor data and process it at the rate of the motor schema. In other cases, the update rate of the motor schema may be faster than the update rate of the perceptual schema, in which case the robot may have to use a prediction algorithm to estimate the sensor readings based on the previous sensor readings.

    In summary, the perceptual schema and the motor schema for a behavior can execute asynchronously, meaning they can have different update rates, and this depends on the type of sensors and actuators used and the frequency at which they produce new data or need to be updated to execute the desired actions.

4. Fig. 5.2 shows two methods of implementing a potential fields-based follow-corridor behavior. A third way is to have two instances of a move-away-from-wall (perpendicular) behavior with a move-parallel-to-wall behavior. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an implementation?

    <p align="center">
    <img src="../../docs/image/potential_field.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    </p>

    This method involves using two perpendicular forces, one on each side of the robot, to push the robot away from the walls of the corridor, while also using a parallel force to guide the robot along the center of the corridor.

    Advantages of this implementation include:

    * Increased robustness: By having two perpendicular forces, one on each side of the robot, the robot is less likely to get stuck in corners or against walls, as it can always move away from obstacles on either side.
    * Greater flexibility: The robot can navigate through corridors of varying widths, as the perpendicular forces can be adjusted to adapt to the width of the corridor.
    * Better sensing: By using two instances of a move-away-from-wall behavior, the robot can sense the walls on both sides and can adjust its trajectory accordingly.

    Disadvantages of this implementation include:

    * Increased complexity: The use of three different behaviors (two perpendicular and one parallel) increases the complexity of the implementation, making it more difficult to design, test, and debug.
    * Increased computational requirements: The use of three different behaviors increases the computational requirements of the implementation, which may be a concern for systems with limited resources.
    * Greater susceptibility to noise: Using two instances of a move-away-from-wall behavior may be more susceptible to noise in the sensor data, as the robot may react to phantom obstacles if the sensor readings are not accurate.

    In conclusion, the third way of implementing a potential fields-based follow-corridor behavior has its advantages such as increased robustness, greater flexibility and better sensing but also has its disadvantages such as increased complexity, increased computational requirements and greater susceptibility to noise.
    
5. List and describe the steps in designing a reactive system.

    Designing a reactive system can be broken down into the following steps:

    5.1. Define the problem: The first step in designing a reactive system is to clearly define the problem that the system is supposed to solve. This includes identifying the goals and objectives of the system, as well as the constraints and limitations of the system.

    5.2. Identify the sensors and actuators: The next step is to identify the sensors and actuators that the system will use to perceive and act in the environment. This includes selecting the appropriate sensors and actuators for the task, as well as determining how the data from the sensors will be used to control the actuators.
    
    5.3. Design the reactive behaviors: The third step is to design the reactive behaviors that the system will use to react to the environment. This includes identifying the conditions that will trigger each behavior, as well as the actions that the system will take in response to those conditions.

    5.4. Implement the system: After the behaviors are designed, the next step is to implement the system. This includes writing the code that will run the system, as well as configuring the sensors and actuators.

    5.5. Test the system: The fifth step is to test the system to ensure that it is working correctly. This includes running simulations and conducting experiments to evaluate the performance of the system.

    5.6. Optimize the system: The final step is to optimize the system based on the results of the testing. This includes adjusting the parameters of the system, such as the weights of the potential fields, and fine-tuning the system to improve its performance.

6. Consider the Pick Up the Trash example in Sec. 5.5.2. The example assumed the arena was empty except for walls, cans, and trash cans. What would happen if there were chairs and tables present? Could the gripper accidently scoop a chair or table leg? How would the system react? What changes, if any, would need to be made to the behavior table and FSA?

    If there were chairs and tables present in the Pick Up the Trash example, the gripper could accidentally scoop a chair or table leg. The system would likely react by trying to grasp the object and failing, and then continuing to wander around looking for cans and trash. To prevent this from happening, changes would need to be made to the behavior table and FSA. One possible solution would be to add a new state to the FSA for "Identifying Objects", where the robot would use its sensors to determine if an object is a can or trash, a chair or table leg before trying to pick it up. Additionally, the behavior table would need to be adjusted to include new behaviors for identifying and avoiding non-target objects like chairs and tables. This could include behaviors such as "Avoid Obstacles" and "Identify Objects" that would be activated when the robot comes into contact with an object that is not a can or trash.

9.  How is defining a robot’s behaviors linked to the robot’s ecological niche?

    Defining a robot's behaviors is closely linked to the robot's ecological niche, as the behaviors of a robot are designed to allow the robot to successfully navigate and interact with its environment. The ecological niche of a robot refers to the specific role and tasks that the robot is designed to perform within its environment, as well as the specific conditions and constraints that the robot is able to operate under.

    When designing the behaviors for a robot, the robot's ecological niche must be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the robot is able to effectively perform its intended tasks and function within its environment. For example, if a robot is designed to operate in a factory setting, its behaviors would need to be tailored to the specific conditions and constraints of the factory environment, such as navigating around obstacles, avoiding collisions with other machinery, and picking up and transporting parts.

    Similarly, if a robot is designed to operate in an outdoor environment, its behaviors would need to be tailored to the specific conditions and constraints of the outdoor environment, such as navigating rough terrain, avoiding obstacles, and dealing with changing weather conditions.

    In summary, defining a robot's behaviors is closely linked to the robot's ecological niche as the behaviors must be tailored to the specific conditions and constraints of the environment in which the robot will operate. This will allow the robot to effectively perform its intended tasks and function within its environment.

10. What is special about a primitive behavior in terms of perceptual and motor schema?

    A primitive behavior is considered special because it is a basic, simple behavior that a robot can perform using a specific set of perceptual and motor schema. These schema are typically hard-wired into the robot's control system and are not easily changed or modified. They are designed to allow the robot to perform a specific task or respond to a specific stimulus in a pre-determined way. For example, a primitive behavior for a robot might include avoiding obstacles or following a specific path. These behaviors are often used as building blocks for more complex behaviors.

11. Construct a Behavioral Table of the behaviors needed for a robot to move from room to room.

    |Behavior|Perceptual Schema|Motor Schema|
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    |Move to Room|Detect Room|Move towards Room|
    |Avoid Obstacles|Detect Obstacles|Move around Obstacles
    |Open Door|Detect Door|Open Door
    |Move Through Door|None|Move through Open Door|
    |Close Door|Detect Open Door|Close Open Door|

    Note: The behaviors listed above are basic behaviors that would be needed for a robot to move from room to room. Additional behaviors, such as detecting and navigating stairs or elevators, would also be necessary depending on the specific environment and layout of the building. The perceptual schema and motor schema listed above are not exhaustive and may require further refinement depending on the specific implementation of the robot.

12. What are the two main deficits encountered when designing and implementing reactive robotic systems?

    The two main deficits encountered when designing and implementing reactive robotic systems are:

    1. The lack of a clear and consistent world model: Reactive systems rely heavily on sensor input to make decisions, but sensors can be unreliable and can produce inconsistent or contradictory information. This can lead to difficulties in defining the robot's behavior and in making robust and reliable decisions.

    2. The lack of ability to handle complex tasks: Reactive systems are designed to handle simple tasks that require quick decisions, but they are not well suited to tasks that require long-term planning or that involve multiple steps. This can limit the range of tasks that a reactive robotic system can handle.

13. Make up a task for a robot to complete. Describe what each of the 7 steps of the design methodology would require you to do to complete the task.

    ### **Task: Clean the dishes in a kitchen**

    #### Step 1: 
    Defining the task - Clearly define the task that the robot needs to complete, in this case, cleaning the dishes in a kitchen. This includes determining the specific tasks involved (e.g. washing, drying, putting away), the objects involved (e.g. dishes, silverware, pots and pans), and the environment (e.g. kitchen layout, location of sink and dishwasher).

    #### Step 2: 
    Identifying the behaviors - Identify the specific behaviors that the robot will need to complete the task. This includes behaviors such as moving to the sink, picking up dishes, washing them, drying them, and putting them away.

    #### Step 3: 
    Modeling the environment - Create a model of the kitchen environment, including the layout, location of objects, and potential obstacles. This will be used to guide the robot's movements and actions.

    #### Step 4: 
    Designing the control system - Design the control system that will govern the robot's actions and behaviors. This includes determining how the robot will sense its environment, how it will make decisions about its actions, and how it will execute those actions.

    #### Step 5: 
    Programming the robot - Write the code that will control the robot's actions and behaviors, based on the design of the control system. This includes programming the robot to sense its environment, make decisions, and execute actions.

    #### Step 6: 
    Testing and evaluating - Test and evaluate the robot's performance, by observing its actions in the kitchen environment. This includes assessing whether the robot is able to complete the task effectively and efficiently, and identifying any problems that need to be addressed.

    #### Step 7: 
    Refining and improving - Based on the results of the testing and evaluation, make any necessary adjustments to the robot's design, control system, or programming. Repeat the testing and evaluation process until the robot is able to complete the task to the desired level of performance.

14. Describe the two methods for assembling primitive behaviors into abstract behaviors: finite state automata and scripts.

    The two methods for assembling primitive behaviors into abstract behaviors are finite state automata (FSA) and scripts.

    Finite state automata is a method of combining primitive behaviors into abstract behaviors by using a set of states and transitions between those states. Each state represents a specific behavior or action, and the transitions between states are triggered by certain conditions or events. For example, a robot may have a "pick up object" behavior that is triggered when the robot detects an object within its reach, and a "drop object" behavior that is triggered when the robot has reached its destination.

    Scripts, on the other hand, are a method of combining primitive behaviors into abstract behaviors by using a sequence of commands or instructions. Each command in the script corresponds to a specific primitive behavior, and the script is executed in a specific order. For example, a robot may have a script for "navigating to a specific location" that includes commands for "moving forward," "turning left," and "stopping" in a specific order.

    Both FSA and scripts are used to combine primitive behaviors into abstract behaviors to achieve a specific task or goal. FSA is often used for real-time control of robotic systems, while scripts are often used for more complex tasks that require a specific sequence of actions.

15. Assume that the CSM robot had been wider and needed to use an avoid-obstacle behavior. Make a Behavior Table to include this new behavior.

    Behavior|Perceptual Schema|Motor Schema
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    Follow-Line|Detect White Line|Move Forward
    Turn-Right|Detect Right Turn|Turn Right
    Turn-Left|Detect Left Turn|Turn Left
    Avoid-Obstacle|Detect Obstacle|Move Away from Obstacle
    In this behavior table, the "Avoid-Obstacle" behavior has been added to account for the wider width of the CSM robot. The perceptual schema for this behavior is "Detect Obstacle," which uses sensors to identify any obstacles in the robot's path. The motor schema for this behavior is "Move Away from Obstacle," which directs the robot to move in the opposite direction of the detected obstacle in order to avoid it. This behavior would be activated in coordination with the existing "Follow-Line" behavior, in order to ensure that the robot can continue to navigate the course while avoiding obstacles.

16. Assuming the state of the robot in question 1, describe how the coordinated control program should handle concurrent behaviors.

    The coordinated control program should handle concurrent behaviors by using a priority system. Each behavior is assigned a priority level, with higher priority behaviors taking precedence over lower priority behaviors. When multiple behaviors are active at the same time, the behavior with the highest priority will be executed while the others are temporarily suspended. For example, if the avoid-obstacle behavior is assigned a higher priority than the follow-line behavior, the robot will prioritize avoiding obstacles over following the white line. This ensures that the robot's safety is maintained while still allowing it to complete its task. Additionally, the coordinated control program should also have a mechanism for resolving conflicts between behaviors, such as by prioritizing certain behaviors over others or by adjusting the parameters of the behaviors.

17. Recall how some mammals freeze when they see motion (an affordance for a predator) in an attempt to become invisible, and persist in this behavior until the predator is very close, then flee. Define this behavior using Behavior Tables.

    |Behavior     |Preconditions|Actions      |Postconditions   |
    |-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------    |
    |Freeze       |Predator is detected and far away|Stand still and reduce movement|Predator is close|
    |Flee         |Predator is detected and close| Run away at high speed|Predator is no longer detected or too far away to pose threat|
    
    Note: This behavior table assumes that the robot is able to detect predators and determine their distance, as well as respond to the "freeze" and "flee" behaviors through its motors and sensors. It also assumes that the robot has a way to determine when the predator is no longer a threat and can return to its previous behavior.

18. Suppose the competition course described in Section 5.4 (Case Study: Unmanned Ground Robotics Competition) has been modified so that a hay bale can be placed directly on the white line. The robot must move around the bale and rejoin the line on the other side. Create a behavior table that not only follows the line but correctly responds to the bale so that it can continue following the line.

    Behavior|Preconditions|Action|Postconditions
    |-------------|-------------|-------------|------------- |
    Follow Line|Robot is on white line|Move forward while keeping sensors on line|Robot continues to follow white line
    Avoid Obstacle|Obstacle (hay bale) detected on white line|Turn left or right to avoid obstacle and rejoin white line|Robot successfully avoids obstacle and continues to follow white line

19. [World Wide Web] Search the web for the International Association for Unmanned Systems competition home page and briefly describe three unmanned vehicle projects linked to the IAUS site

    The International Association for Unmanned Systems (IAUS) is a non-profit organization that promotes the development and use of unmanned systems through education, research, and competition. The organization hosts a variety of unmanned vehicle competitions, such as the Unmanned Ground Robotics Competition, the Unmanned Aerial Robotics Competition, and the Unmanned Marine Robotics Competition.

    Three unmanned vehicle projects that are linked to the IAUS site include:

    - The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Challenge: This competition focuses on the development of autonomous UAVs for use in civilian and military applications. The competition includes tasks such as aerial navigation, surveillance, and search and rescue.

    - The Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Challenge: This competition focuses on the development of autonomous USVs for use in civilian and military applications. The competition includes tasks such as navigation, surveillance, and search and rescue.

    - The Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Challenge: This competition focuses on the development of autonomous UGVs for use in civilian and military applications. The competition includes tasks such as navigation, surveillance, and search and rescue.

20. [World Wide Web] Identify at least 5 robot competitions, and for each describe the basic task. Can the task be accomplished with a reactive robot? Why or why not?

    1. The DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) - The basic task of this competition is to have robots complete a series of tasks that simulate a disaster response scenario, such as driving a vehicle, climbing stairs, and operating tools. It would be difficult for a reactive robot to accomplish these tasks as they require a higher level of cognitive reasoning and planning.

    2. RoboCup - This competition focuses on developing teams of robots that can play soccer against each other. The basic task is for the robots to move around the field, locate and kick the ball into the opposing team's goal. This task may be accomplished with a reactive robot as it only requires simple sensor-based movements and decision-making.

    3. NASA Swarmathon - The goal of this competition is to develop algorithms for swarms of robots to work together to accomplish a task. The basic task is for the robots to navigate through a simulated environment and collect resources, such as water and minerals. This task may be accomplished with a reactive robot as it only requires simple sensor-based movements and decision-making.

    4. Amazon Robotics Challenge - The goal of this competition is to develop robots that can perform tasks such as picking and packing items in a warehouse setting. The basic task is for the robot to locate, grasp, and place items in a specific location. This task may be accomplished with a reactive robot as it only requires simple sensor-based movements and decision-making.

    5. The CyberMotion Challenge - The goal of this competition is to develop robots that can navigate and interact with an unknown environment. The basic task is for the robot to navigate through an unknown environment, locate and interact with specific objects, and return to the starting location. This task would be difficult for a reactive robot as it requires a higher level of cognitive reasoning and planning.

21. [Programming] Using Rug Warrior kits, Lego Mindstorms kits, or similar robotics tools, implement your own schools version of an IAUS Unmanned Ground Robotics Competition. Your class should decide on the course, the course objectives, rules, and prizes (if any). Groups should not begin construction of their robot without first describing the steps involved in designing a reactive behavioral system for the task at hand.

- No answer is required

22. [Programming] Write a script in pseudo-code for following a hallway. Consider that the robot may start in a hallway intersection facing away from the hallway it is supposed to take. Also the robot might start in the middle of a hall facing a wall, rather than having forward point to the long axis of the hall.

    ```
    # Script for following a hallway

    # Initialize robot's starting position
    currentPosition = getCurrentPosition()

    # Check if robot is in an intersection
    if isIntersection(currentPosition):
        # Turn robot towards the desired hallway
        turnToHallway(currentPosition)

    # Check if robot is facing a wall
    if isFacingWall(currentPosition):
        # Turn robot to face the long axis of the hallway
        turnToHallway(currentPosition)

    # Initialize variable to track if end of hallway is reached
    endReached = False

    # Begin following the hallway
    while not endReached:
        # Move forward
        moveForward()
        # Update current position
        currentPosition = getCurrentPosition()
        # Check for end of hallway
        if isEndOfHallway(currentPosition):
            endReached = True
        # Check for intersection
        elif isIntersection(currentPosition):
            # Turn robot towards the desired hallway
            turnToHallway(currentPosition)
        # Check if robot is facing a wall
        elif isFacingWall(currentPosition):
            # Turn robot to face the long axis of the hallway
            turnToHallway(currentPosition)

    # End of script
    ```

    The script is written in pseudo-code and it's not a real programming language. The script uses functions like getCurrentPosition(), isIntersection(), turnToHallway(), moveForward(), isEndOfHallway() and isFacingWall() which are not defined here. It's possible to implement this script using a reactive robot as it does not require any planning or decision-making, it just follows a set of predefined rules. The robot uses sensor input to detect the current position and react accordingly.

23. [Programming] The Pick Up the Trash competitions were a bit different than actually presented in this book. For example, the robots were actually permitted to cache up to three cans before going to the trash can, and the robots could go after white Styrofoam cups as trash. How would you integrate this into:
    a. the FSA and
    b. the script described in the book?

    a. The FSA (finite state automata) would need to be updated to include new states for caching up to three cans and for recognizing and collecting white Styrofoam cups as trash. The transition conditions for these new states would also need to be defined. For example, a new state for caching cans could be triggered when the robot detects a can and the number of cached cans is less than three. A new state for recognizing and collecting white Styrofoam cups as trash could be triggered when the robot detects a white Styrofoam cup.

    b. The script described in the book would need to be updated to include new commands for caching up to three cans and for recognizing and collecting white Styrofoam cups as trash. For example, new commands such as "cache can" and "collect white cup" would need to be added to the script. The script would also need to be updated to include conditions for checking the number of cached cans and for recognizing white Styrofoam cups as trash. For example, the script would need to check if the number of cached cans is less than three before caching a new can and check if the detected object is a white Styrofoam cup before collecting it as trash.

24. [Programming] Could the exception handling sub-scripts for picking up trash be implemented with the exception handling functionality provided by Ada or C++?

    Yes, the exception handling sub-scripts for picking up trash could be implemented with the exception handling functionality provided by C++. C++ provides the try-catch block and the throw statement, which can be used to handle exceptions and errors in the script. The try-catch block can be used to catch any exceptions that are thrown by the script and handle them accordingly. The throw statement can be used to throw an exception if an error occurs in the script, such as if the robot is unable to pick up a trash can. In addition, C++ also provides other exception handling mechanisms such as exception specifications, noexcept, and exception handling classes like std::exception which can also be used to handle exceptions in the script.

    ```C++
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        int trashCount = 0;
        int trashCapacity = 3;
        bool trashCanReached = false;

        // Pick up trash
        try {
            if (trashCount < trashCapacity) {
                trashCount++;
                cout << "Picked up trash" << endl;
            } else {
                throw trashCanReached;
            }
        } catch (bool trashCanReached) {
            cout << "Trash can reached. Emptying trash." << endl;
            trashCount = 0;
        }

        return 0;
    }

25. [Advanced Reading] Read Rodney Brooks’ one paragraph introduction to Chapter 1 in Cambrian Intelligence on the lack of mathematics in behavioral robotics. Now consider the behavior of the CSM robot around white shoes and dandelions. Certainly it would be useful to have theories which can prove when a behavioral system will fail. Is it possible?

    It is possible to have theories that can prove when a behavioral system will fail, but it is not always easy or straightforward. In the case of the CSM robot around white shoes and dandelions, it would likely require a detailed mathematical analysis of the robot's sensors and behaviors, as well as a thorough understanding of the environment in which the robot is operating. Additionally, it would be important to consider the specific goals and constraints of the robot's task, as well as any potential sources of error or uncertainty. While it may be challenging, it is certainly possible to develop mathematical theories that can predict and prevent behavioral failures in robotic systems.
