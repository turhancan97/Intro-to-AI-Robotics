1. Give three reasons why multi-agents are desirable. Describe the general attributes of applications which are well-suited for multi-agents, and give one example.

Three reasons why multi-agents are desirable are:

    Scalability - Multi-agents can be easily scaled up or down to handle different tasks, making them more flexible than single-agent systems.
    Distributed problem solving - Multi-agents allow for tasks to be divided among multiple agents, allowing for a more efficient use of resources and distributed problem solving.
    Robustness - Multi-agents are more robust than single-agent systems because if one agent fails, the other agents can continue to function, minimizing downtime.

Applications that are well-suited for multi-agents include complex problem solving, such as financial planning or network security, where multiple agents can work together to provide a more comprehensive solution. One example of this is a network security system that uses multiple agents to monitor and detect potential security threats.

Three reasons why multi-agents are desirable in robotics are:

    Distributed decision making: Multi-agent systems can distribute the decision making process among multiple agents, leading to more efficient and effective solutions.

    Flexibility and scalability: Multi-agent systems can be designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy adaptation to new tasks and environments.

    Robustness: With multiple agents working together, a multi-agent system can be more robust and less likely to fail due to single point of failure.

Applications that are well-suited for multi-agent systems in robotics include swarm robotics, where multiple robots work together to perform a task, and multi-robot systems, where multiple robots are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An example of a multi-agent system in robotics is a swarm of drones that work together to search for and map a disaster area.

2. Define the following: a. heterogeneity, b. control, c. cooperation, d. goals

a. **Heterogeneity**: In multi-agent systems, heterogeneity refers to the differences between agents in terms of abilities, objectives, and other attributes. This term is often used to describe the diverse and dynamic nature of multi-agent systems, which can consist of a range of different types of agents that are not necessarily the same. Heterogeneity simply refers to the degree of similarity between individual robots that are within a collection.

b. **Control**: In multi-agent systems, control refers to the ability of agents to exert influence over one another. This can include direct control, such as one agent issuing commands to another, as well as indirect control, such as one agent influencing the behavior of another through incentives or penalties.

c. **Cooperation**: In multi-agent systems, cooperation refers to the coordination of agent activities to achieve a common goal. This can involve agents working together directly or indirectly, such as through the sharing of information or the delegation of tasks.

d. **Goals**: In multi-agent systems, goals refer to the objectives that agents are trying to achieve. This can include individual goals, such as maximizing performance or reducing costs, as well as shared goals, such as completing a task or solving a problem together.

3. Consider the example of space ants. What would happen if the first robot communicated with the other robots to recruit them to help move the asteroid? Would the behaviors or the goal structure necessarily change? Why or why not?

In the example of space ants, if the first robot communicated with the other robots to recruit them to help move the asteroid, the goal structure would change. The goal of the first robot would change from moving the asteroid alone to coordinating with the other robots to move the asteroid together. The goal structure would change as the first robot would be working with other agents to achieve a common goal.

However, the behaviors of the robots may not necessarily change. The robots would still use the same strategies to move the asteroid, but the coordination between the robots would result in a more efficient and effective movement of the asteroid. The robots may use their individual strengths to complement each other and achieve the goal.

Overall, the goal structure would change as the robots would be working together to achieve a common goal, while the behaviors may or may not change depending on the strategies used to achieve the goal.

4. Draw a FSA or write a script to coordinate the sequencing of the Pick Up the Trash behaviors for Io, Ganymede, and Callisto.

```python
# Define the Pick Up the Trash behavior for each robot
def pick_up_trash_io():
    # Code for Io to pick up trash
    print("Io is picking up trash")

def pick_up_trash_ganymede():
    # Code for Ganymede to pick up trash
    print("Ganymede is picking up trash")

def pick_up_trash_callisto():
    # Code for Callisto to pick up trash
    print("Callisto is picking up trash")

# Coordinate the sequencing of the Pick Up the Trash behaviors for Io, Ganymede, and Callisto
pick_up_trash_io()
pick_up_trash_ganymede()
pick_up_trash_callisto()
>>> Io is picking up trash
>>> Ganymede is picking up trash
>>> Callisto is picking up trash
```

5. Describe three approaches to societal behavior: social rules, internal motivation, and leadership.

Social Rules: This approach to societal behavior is based on the idea that individuals within a society follow a set of established rules and norms that govern their behavior. This can include laws, customs, and traditions that dictate what is acceptable and what is not. In this model, individuals are motivated to comply with these rules because of the consequences that may result from breaking them, such as punishment or social exclusion.

Internal Motivation: This approach to societal behavior emphasizes that individuals have inherent motivations that drive their behavior. This can include personal interests, values, and goals that shape their decisions and actions. In this model, individuals are motivated to act in a certain way because they are driven by their own internal motivations and desires.

Leadership: This approach to societal behavior focuses on the role of leaders and their ability to influence and guide the behavior of others. In this model, individuals are motivated to follow the actions and decisions of their leaders, who act as role models and provide guidance and direction. Leaders can be formal or informal, and their influence may be based on their personal charisma, experience, or expertise.

6. Were the behaviors for the Nerd Herd purely reactive? Why or why not?

The behaviors for the Nerd Herd were not purely reactive because they were programmed using the Subsumption architecture, which is a hybrid architecture that incorporates both reactive and deliberative elements. The robots were given a goal, which is a deliberate and proactive aspect of their behavior, and they had to navigate through the narrow door, which was accomplished through reactive behaviors such as avoiding obstacles and following the wall. The combination of proactive goal-oriented behavior and reactive obstacle avoidance shows that the behaviors for the Nerd Herd were not purely reactive.

7. [Programming)] Implement the space ant example with 3-5 robots capable of phototaxis and dead reckoning.
a. Multi-agent foraging. Start with only a phototropic and avoid-robot behavior, where a robot is an obstacle that isn’t a light. The program will start with an empty world consisting of a light (you may need to make a "bigger light" by placing lights next to each other). Between 2 and 5 phototropic robots will be placed at different random starting locations in the world. Each will wander through the world, avoiding obstacles, until it comes to a light. Then it will move directly to the light (attractive field). If more than one robot is attracted to the same light, they should center themselves evenly around the light. Compare this with the program in Ch. 5 which had a single robot forage for lights. Which gets more lights faster?
b. Cooperating to bring the food home. Now add the push-to-home behavior where the robot wants to be on a straight line behind the light to home. What happens now?

8. [World Wide Web] Visit the RoboCup web site at www.robocup.org. Which team has performed the best over the past 3 years? Describe the multi-agent organization in terms of control and cooperation.

According to the RoboCup website, the top performing teams in the past few years have been from Japan and Germany. The team from Japan, specifically the team from the University of Tokyo, has consistently performed well in the RoboCup Humanoid League.

The multi-agent organization in RoboCup is designed to demonstrate control and cooperation among robots. The robots must work together to achieve a common goal, such as playing soccer. They use a combination of individual control and cooperative behaviors to move the ball and score goals. For example, one robot may have control over the ball while others work to create passing opportunities and open spaces. The robots must also cooperate to defend the goal and prevent the other team from scoring. This requires coordination and communication among the robots to achieve a common goal.

9. [Advanced Reading] Read Ed Durfee’s humorous invited paper on DAI, “What Your Computer Really Needs to Know, You Learned in Kindergarten” (proceedings of the Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1992). For each of his ten issues (“Share Everything,” “Play Fair,” etc.), describe how this applies to robots. For each issue give an example of how it applies to a robot team described in this chapter.

10.  [Advanced Reading] Read and summarize “Behavior-Based Formation Control for Multirobot Teams,” by Tucker Balch and Ron Arkin in IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, vol. 14, no 6., 1998.

The article "Behavior-Based Formation Control for Multirobot Teams" by Tucker Balch and Ron Arkin focuses on the use of behavior-based control for multi-robot teams to accomplish formation tasks. The authors propose a behavior-based approach to control robots in formation and present the algorithms and results of simulations to show the effectiveness of this approach. The behavior-based approach allows robots to coordinate their movements and maintain a formation while completing a task, such as mapping or exploration. The results show that the behavior-based approach is a practical and effective solution for multi-robot teams, as it provides robust and scalable control for the formation of multiple robots. The authors conclude that the behavior-based formation control method is an important step towards the development of practical, autonomous robot teams.

11.  [Science Fiction] Watch the movie "Silent Running" about a team of three mobile robots (Huey, Dewey, and Louie) working on a space station. Classify their teamwork in terms of heterogeneity, control, cooperation and goals.

In the movie "Silent Running," the three mobile robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie are designed to work together in a team to maintain and protect a space station's greenhouse. The robots display characteristics of heterogeneity in their design and functionality, as each robot is specialized in performing different tasks.

In terms of control, the robots are controlled by a central computer, which assigns tasks and goals to each robot. However, they also display some autonomy in performing their assigned tasks.

The cooperation between the robots is demonstrated through their coordination in carrying out tasks and their ability to work together in order to achieve their goal of protecting the greenhouse. They communicate with each other to ensure the successful completion of their tasks.

The robots share the same goal of preserving the greenhouse, which is evident in the way they work together to maintain the environment and protect it from any potential threats. Overall, the teamwork displayed by the robots in "Silent Running" showcases a combination of heterogeneity, control, cooperation, and shared goals.
