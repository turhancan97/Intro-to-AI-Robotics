# Part 1 - Robotic Paradigms

The First Part of the book "Introduction to AI Robotics" by Robin R. Murphy explores different robotic paradigms, the underlying principles and design methods used in these paradigms.

**Chapter** 1 provides an overview of the evolution of robotic systems from teleoperation to autonomy. It highlights the development of robotic systems and how the paradigm has shifted from manual control to autonomous operation.

**Chapter** 2 focuses on the hierarchical paradigm, which consists of multiple levels of control, including perception, deliberation, and action. It highlights how the hierarchical paradigm has been applied in various domains and the advantages it offers over other paradigms.

**Chapter** 3 provides a biological foundation for the reactive paradigm, which is based on the response of animals to the environment. The **chapter** explores the underlying principles of the reactive paradigm and how it can be applied in robotics.

**Chapter** 4 discusses the reactive paradigm in detail, including the basic components, behaviors, and design principles of reactive systems. It also highlights the limitations of the reactive paradigm and its applications in various domains.

**Chapter** 5 explores the design of reactive systems, including the methods and techniques used to design reactive implementations. It covers the different design approaches, including finite state machines, rule-based systems, and decision trees.

**Chapter** 6 focuses on the common sensing techniques used in reactive robots, including proximity sensors, infrared sensors, and sonar sensors. It highlights the different types of sensors and their applications in various domains.

**Chapter** 7 introduces the hybrid deliberative/reactive paradigm, which is a combination of the hierarchical and reactive paradigms. The **chapter** covers the design principles and applications of the hybrid paradigm and the advantages it offers over other paradigms.

**Chapter** 8 explores multi-agent systems, where multiple robots work together to achieve a common goal. It highlights the different types of multi-agent systems and their applications in various domains.

In conclusion, the First Part of the book provides a comprehensive overview of the different robotic paradigms, including the hierarchical, reactive, hybrid deliberative/reactive, and multi-agent paradigms. The book provides a foundation for understanding the design and operation of autonomous robots.
