1. List the four questions associated with navigation.

* Where am I?
* Where do I want to go?
* How do I get there?
* What should I do if I encounter an obstacle or unexpected event?

2. List and describe the criteria for evaluating a path planner.

    Completeness: Does the path planner find a path for any valid start and goal configuration, or does it fail for certain cases?

    Optimality: Is the path generated by the planner the shortest or near-shortest path possible?

    Speed: How quickly does the path planner generate a solution? This is especially important for real-time navigation.

    Simplicity: How easy is the path planner to understand, implement, and integrate with other systems?

    Flexibility: How well does the path planner handle changes in the environment, such as moving obstacles or changes in the cost of traversing certain regions?

    Robustness: How well does the path planner handle uncertainty, such as measurement noise or approximations in the map representation?

    Generalizability: Can the path planner be used in a variety of different environments and applications, or is it specialized for a particular type of scenario?

    Feasibility: Does the path planner generate paths that can actually be executed by the robot, taking into account kinematic and dynamic constraints?

    Safety: Does the path planner avoid collisions and hazardous regions in the environment?

    Scalability: How well does the path planner perform as the size and complexity of the environment increases?

3. Describe the difference between route and metric representations of space.

Route representation of space is a type of map representation that involves specifying a path or a series of actions that must be taken in order to reach a goal. It describes the sequence of locations that must be visited and the actions that must be performed in order to achieve a specific objective. It is particularly useful for navigation tasks where the goal is to reach a specific location, and the robot must determine the best path to follow.

Metric representation of space, on the other hand, involves specifying the physical distances between different locations in the environment. This representation of space is useful for tasks that require precise control of the robot's movement and is based on the notion of a distance metric. In a metric representation, the space is represented as a graph, with the nodes representing locations and the edges representing the distances between these locations. This representation is useful for tasks that require the robot to navigate to a specific location based on a metric, such as the shortest distance, rather than a specific path.

In summary, route representation of space is concerned with the sequence of actions and locations that must be taken to reach a goal, while metric representation of space is concerned with the physical distances between locations in the environment.

4. Define the difference between natural and artificial landmarks and give one example of each.

Natural landmarks are physical features in the environment that are naturally occurring and provide a reference point for navigation. Examples of natural landmarks include mountains, rivers, and rock formations.

Artificial landmarks are man-made structures that serve as reference points for navigation. Examples of artificial landmarks include buildings, road signs, and markers.

5. Define a gateway. What gateways would be in a museum? What sensors would be needed to reliably detect them?

A gateway is a physical or virtual opening in a space that separates or defines different regions or areas.

In a museum, there could be several types of gateways such as doors, halls, or elevators that separate the different exhibitions or rooms.

To reliably detect the gateways in a museum, the following sensors could be used:

    Ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of physical objects such as doors
    Infrared sensors to detect the movement of people or objects near the gateway
    Image recognition or computer vision sensors to detect patterns or markers in the environment that correspond to a specific gateway.

6. Build a relational graph representation labeling the distinctive places and local control strategies using gateways for a floor of a building on campus.

Consider a floor of a hypothetical building on campus that has four rooms: Room A, Room B, Room C, and Room D.

Relational graph representation:

```
Room A ---> Room B
| |
v v
Room C ---> Room D
```

Distinctive places:

    Room A
    Room B
    Room C
    Room D
Local control strategies using gateways:

Room A and Room B are connected by a gateway at the doorway between the two rooms. This gateway can be used to control the flow of robots between the two rooms. For example, the gateway can be programmed to only allow robots to enter Room B if they have completed a specific task in Room A.
Room C and Room D are connected by a similar gateway at their doorway.
Sensors needed to reliably detect gateways:

    Ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of objects (e.g. walls, doorways)
    Infrared sensors to detect changes in temperature (e.g. doorways may have different temperature profiles compared to the surrounding walls)
    Lidar sensors to detect changes in distance (e.g. the doorway may appear as a gap in the distance readings)
These sensors can be used in combination to accurately detect the location of the gateways and enable the robots to navigate between the rooms.

7. Describe each in one or two sentences: gateway, image signature, visual homing, viewframe, orientation region.

A gateway is a physical location or landmark in an environment that separates two or more distinct regions or places.

An image signature is a unique set of features in an image that can be used to identify or recognize that specific image.

Visual homing is a navigation technique that uses visual information to determine the location of the robot and guide it towards a target destination.

A viewframe is a visual representation of the environment as seen by a robot's camera or sensors.

An orientation region is a region in space where the robot's orientation is defined or fixed relative to its surroundings.

8. Create a topological map showing landmarks, landmark pair boundaries, and orientation regions for an area of campus.

To create a topological map, you first need to identify landmarks in the area of the campus. These can be anything that is distinctive and easily recognizable, such as buildings, sculptures, or street signs.

Next, you need to determine the boundaries between landmark pairs. This can be done by physically walking the area and noting the locations where one landmark becomes visible and another becomes obscured.

Finally, you need to define the orientation regions for each landmark. This can be done by walking around the landmark and noting the directions from which it is visible.

Once you have this information, you can create a topological map by plotting the landmarks, connecting the landmark pairs with lines to indicate the boundaries between them, and marking the orientation regions for each landmark.

9.  Consider the spatial hierarchy of Kuipers and Byun. Do these three levels fit naturally within a Hybrid architecture? How would they be implemented in a state-hierarchy style? A model-oriented style?

The spatial hierarchy of Kuipers and Byun consists of three levels: the metric level, the topological level, and the semantic level. This hierarchy can fit naturally within a Hybrid architecture by combining the metric and topological representations to create a more complete representation of the environment.

In a state-hierarchy style, the three levels of the spatial hierarchy would be implemented as separate levels in the state space, with the metric level representing the raw sensory data, the topological level representing the relationships between landmarks, and the semantic level representing the meaning of the landmarks and their relationships.

In a model-oriented style, the three levels of the spatial hierarchy would be represented as separate models, with the metric level being represented as a probability distribution over the state space, the topological level as a graph representation of the environment, and the semantic level as a set of rules or constraints that describe the relationships between landmarks and the meaning of the landmarks.

In either style, the three levels of the spatial hierarchy would be used in combination to create a comprehensive representation of the environment and allow for more sophisticated navigation and problem-solving.

10. Did Minerva use topological navigation? What did it use for landmarks?

Minerva used topological navigation and used objects in the environment as landmarks. These objects were categorized into semantic classes such as buildings, trees, and signs, and their location was represented in a topological map. The map was used to plan paths between waypoints and to guide the robot's movements in the environment.

11. [World Wide Web] Visit the Minerva site as http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Minerva. Write a one-page paper summarizing the project.

Minerva is a talking robot designed to accommodate people in public spaces. She perceives her environment through her sensors (cameras, laser range finders, ultrasonic sensors), and decides what to do using her computers. Minerva actively approaches people, offers tours, and then leads them from exhibit to exhibit. When Minerva is happy, she sings and smiles at nearby people. But don't block her way too often--otherwise, she'll become frustrated and might frown at you and honk her horn!

The goal of the Minerva project is to bring robots closer to people. Recent progress in robotics and artificial intelligence has made it possible to build interactive mobile robots that operate highly reliably in crowded environments. In the next decade, robots like Minerva are expected to become part of many people's lives, where they will assist them in their everyday activities, perform janitorial services, or simply entertain them. This project is carried out jointly by Carnegie Mellon University's Robot Learning Laboratory and the University of Bonn's Computer Science Department III, and sponsored by the Lemelson Center at the National Museum of American History. Minerva is a next generation robotic tourguide, built by the same group that developed the world's first robotic museum tourguide Rhino, displayed in the Deutsches Museum Bonn.

Minerva was designed to navigate by using a combination of topological, metric and hybrid navigation techniques. The topological navigation was based on a relational graph representation of the environment, where the robot could move between different rooms and locations by following connections and relationships between landmarks.

For metric navigation, Minerva used visual landmarks, such as paintings and sculptures, to establish its position and orientation within the environment. The robot used image signatures to identify these landmarks and used visual homing to find its way back to them if it became disoriented.

Minerva also used a hybrid navigation approach, combining both topological and metric information to create a more robust and flexible navigation system. The robot used a state-hierarchy style to represent its current position, orientation, and goals, and a model-oriented style to represent the environment and the relationships between landmarks.

The Minerva project was successful in demonstrating that autonomous mobile robots can navigate and operate in complex environments such as museums and historic sites. The project contributed to the development of new technologies and algorithms for autonomous navigation and helped to advance the field of robotics and AI.

12. [Advanced Reading] Read the scientific papers at the Minerva web site. Describe: a. The path planner used and evaluate it using the criteria presented in this overview. b. Discuss the impact of sensor uncertainty on Minerva’s navigation and how it was addressed. c. List which of the four functions of spatial memory were used. 

Minerva was a mobile robot project developed at Carnegie Mellon University in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The goal of the project was to develop a mobile robot capable of autonomous navigation and mapping in an unknown environment.

a. The path planner used in Minerva was a graph-based approach, where the robot's environment was represented as a graph of nodes connected by edges. The robot used a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from its current location to its destination. This approach was effective in providing the robot with a high-level view of the environment, allowing it to avoid obstacles and navigate efficiently. In terms of evaluating the path planner, it can be said that it provided the robot with a high level of reliability and efficiency, but it may not have been as adaptable as some other path planning algorithms.

b. Sensor uncertainty was a major challenge for Minerva's navigation, as the robot was equipped with a limited set of sensors that were prone to errors and inaccuracies. To address this issue, Minerva used a combination of probabilistic techniques and machine learning algorithms to estimate the uncertainty of its sensor readings and update its navigation accordingly. This approach was effective in reducing the impact of sensor uncertainty on the robot's navigation, but it may not have been as robust as some other techniques.

c. In terms of the four functions of spatial memory, Minerva used a combination of topological and metric representations to store information about its environment. The robot used topological memory to represent the relationships between different parts of its environment, while it used metric memory to store information about the distances and orientations between different landmarks. This approach allowed Minerva to efficiently navigate and map its environment, while also allowing it to quickly recall important information about its surroundings.

14. [Programming] Look up the following algorithms and describe how they work. Can they be used interchangeably? a. Dijkstra’s single source shortest path b. hill-climbing 

a. Dijkstra's single source shortest path is a graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a graph. It works by iteratively visiting nodes, maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit based on their current distance from the source node, and updating the distances of neighboring nodes as they are visited. This algorithm can only be used for graphs with non-negative edge weights.

> run q14_1.py code
In this example, the graph is represented as a dictionary where each node is a key, and its value is a dictionary of its neighboring nodes and their weights. The dijkstra function takes the graph and the starting node as inputs and returns a dictionary of the shortest distances from the starting node to all other nodes. The algorithm uses a priority queue implemented as a heap to efficiently keep track of the shortest distances.

Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights. If the edge weights can be negative, then the algorithm may not work correctly. In this case, other algorithms such as Bellman-Ford may need to be used.

> run q14_2.py code
In this code, we first create a graph using the networkx library. Then we add nodes and edges to the graph with weights. After that, we find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm and highlight the shortest path by drawing the edges in red color. Finally, we display the graph using the matplotlib library.

b. Hill-climbing is a search algorithm used to find the global maximum (or minimum) of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of increasing (or decreasing) values of the function. It starts at an initial guess and repeatedly makes small moves in the direction of the steepest increase (or decrease) until it reaches a local maximum (or minimum) that cannot be improved by further moves. Hill-climbing algorithms are used in optimization and machine learning.

Dijkstra's algorithm and hill-climbing cannot be used interchangeably. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest path in a graph, while hill-climbing is used for finding the maximum (or minimum) of a function.
