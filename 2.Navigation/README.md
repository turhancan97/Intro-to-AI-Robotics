# Part 2 - Navigation

The second part of the book, Navigation, focuses on the various techniques used to navigate a robot in an unknown environment.

Chapter 9, Topological Path Planning, explains the process of generating a roadmap for a robot to navigate from one location to another in a known environment. This approach uses a graph representation of the environment, with nodes representing landmarks and edges representing paths between them.

Chapter 10, Metric Path Planning, discusses how to find the shortest path between two points in a metric space. It covers algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm.

Chapter 11, Localization and Map Making, explains how a robot can determine its location within a previously generated map. It covers various localization techniques such as Monte Carlo localization, particle filters, and Kalman filters. It also covers map making methods such as occupancy grids, HIMMs, and Gaussian Processes.

Chapter 12, On the Horizon, looks at future directions for navigation research, including integration of multiple sensors, distributed navigation, and cognitive architectures.
